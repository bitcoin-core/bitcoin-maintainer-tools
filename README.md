External repository for Bitcoin Core related maintenance tools.

build-for-compare
--------------------

Build for binary comparison.

See `build-for-compare.py --help` for more information.

Builds from current directory, which is assumed to be a git clone of the bitcoin repository.

**DO NOT RUN this on working tree if you have any local additions, it will nuke all non-repository files, multiple times
over. Ideally this would clone a git tree first to a temporary directory. Suffice to say, it doesn't.**

Example:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git bitcoin-compare
cd bitcoin-compare
../bitcoin-maintainer-tools/build-for-compare.py 4731cab 2f71490
sha256sum /tmp/compare/bitcoind.*.stripped
git diff -W --word-diff /tmp/compare/4731cab /tmp/compare/2f71490
```
